# Data Science First Project

My first semester project of Data Science, i was given the dataset of Horse Colic from UCI, link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Horse+Colic and was assigned to use Naive Bayes classifier on this dataset. This project may contain some mistakes as i was a begineer to DS, but feel free to have a look into it.
